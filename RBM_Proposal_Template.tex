\section{Figures}
Figures should be as small as possible while displaying clearly all the information required, and with all lettering readable. Every effort should be taken to avoid figures that run over more than one page. There is no charge for colour figures. For review purposes figures should be embedded within the manuscript. Upon final acceptance, however, individual figure files will be required for production. These should be submitted in EPS or high-resolution TIFF format (1200 dpi for lines, 300 dpi for halftone, and 600 dpi for a mixture of lines and halftone). The minimum acceptable width of any line is 0.5pt. Each figure should be accompanied by a single caption, to appear beneath, and must be cited in the text. Figures should appear in the order in which they are first mentioned in the text and figure files must be named accordingly to assist the production process (and numbering of figures should continue through any appendices). For example see figures \ref{fig:ka} and \ref{fig:kd}. Failure to follow figure guidelines may result in a request for resupply and a subsequent delay in the production process.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{image/trapped.eps}% Images in 100% size
  \caption{Trapped-mode wavenumbers, $kd$, plotted against $a/d$ for
    three ellipses:\protect\\%
    ---$\!$---,
    $b/a=1$; $\cdots$\,$\cdots$, $b/a=1.5$.}
\label{fig:ka}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{image/modes}
  \caption{The features of the four possible modes corresponding to
  (\textit{a}) periodic\protect\\ and (\textit{b}) half-periodic solutions.}
\label{fig:kd}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}
Tables, however small, must be numbered sequentially in the order in which they are mentioned in the text. The word \textit {table} is only capitalized at the start of a sentence. See table \ref{tab:kd} for an example.

\begin{table}
  
  \begin{center}
\def~{\hphantom{0}}
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
      $a/d$  & $M=4$   &   $M=8$ & Callan \\[3pt]
       0.1   & 1.56905 & ~~1.56~ & 1.56904\\
       0.3   & 1.50484 & ~~1.504 & 1.50484\\
       0.55  & 1.39128 & ~~1.391 & 1.39131\\
       0.7   & 1.32281 & ~10.322 & 1.32288\\
       0.913 & 1.34479 & 100.351 & 1.35185\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Values of $kd$ at which trapped modes occur when $\rho(\theta)=a$}
  \label{tab:kd}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Citations and references}

%All papers included in the References section must be cited in the article, and vice versa. Citations should be included as, for example ``It has been shown \citep{Rogallo81} that...'' (using the {\verb}\citep} command, part of the natbib package) ``recent work by \citet{Dennis85}...'' (using {\verb}\citet}).
The natbib package can be used to generate citation variations, as shown below. \cite{ngFederatedBayesianNetwork2022}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item \verb#\citet[pp. 2-4]{Galtier00}#:
% \citet[pp. 479-480]{Galtier00} 
% \item \verb#\citep[p. 6]{Worster92}#:
% \citep[p. 6]{Worster92}
% \item \verb#\citep[see][]{Koch83, Lee71, Linton92}#:
% \citep[see][]{Koch83, Lee71, Linton92}
% \item \verb#\citep[see][p. 18]{Martin80}#:
% \citep[see][p. 18]{Martin80}
% \item \verb#\citep{Brownell04,Brownell07,Ursell50,Wijngaarden68,Miller91}#:
% \citep{Brownell04,Brownell07,Ursell50,Wijngaarden68,Miller91}
% \end{itemize}

The References section can either be built from individual \verb#\bibitem# commands, or can be built using BibTex. The BibTex files used to generate the references in this document can be found in the zip file in the Instructions for Contributors section of the JPP website.

Where there are up to ten authors, all authors' names should be given in the reference list. Where there are more than ten authors, only the first name should appear, followed by et al.

Acknowledgements should be included at the end of the paper, before the References section or any appendicies, and should be a separate paragraph without a heading. Several anonymous individuals are thanked for contributions to these instructions.
